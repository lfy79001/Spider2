# Spider 2.0-Lite

To align with research interests in **traditional Text2SQL settings**, we released Spider 2.0-Lite. This set is more self-contained, with well-prepared database metadata and documentation, making it a text-in, text-out task that supports faster development and evaluation.


## ðŸš€ Quickstart

1. Download  [local database](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1hZq4Jsx0Gj0bhstrViNF_nbo6Qh6slER&export=download&authuser=0), unzip and put all the `.sqlite` files into directory `spider2-lite/resource/databases/spider2-localdb`.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart
You don't need to download any data. The current version of the database is entirely in the cloud.

If your method doesn't require dynamic interaction with the databases, you can make full use of the data in the [`databases`]() and the content in the [`documentation`]().

If your method requires dynamic interaction with the database, in addition to these, you can use the scripts in the [`interface`]() to interact with the cloud database.

In addition, if you want to view the data in more detail, you need to register for a BigQuery account. Here is a [Bigquery Guideline]().


## Data Content and Format

Each file in `spider2-lite.json` contains the following fields:
- `instance_id`: the unique example id
- `db`: the database id to which this question is addressed
- `question`: the natural language question
- `external_knowledge`: the filenames of external knowledge, documentation, and information required to answer this question are stored in documents
- 
The [`databases`](s) and the content in [`documentation`]() are resources you can use when benchmarking methods.



```
{
    "instance_id": "ga010",
    "db": "bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce",
    "question": "Can you give me an overview of our website traffic for December 2020? I'm particularly interested in the channel with the fourth highest number of sessions.",
    "external_knowledge": "ga4_dimensions_and_metrics.md"
}
```

The gold SQLs are shown in [evaluation_suite/gold/sql]()



## Evaluation

We create [evaluation suite]() for Spider 2.0-Lite.
